Prospecto: My apologies, everyone, but actually... I'm the prince in the story that cast aside the swordstress.

Prospecto: But I was always sincere with her, and never told a bit of a lie.

Tea Cake (skin): Then why did you make up your mind to say all that stuff to her?

Prospecto: That... is something I've always felt sorry to her for...

Prospecto: What happened back then was indeed as you performed it on stage. Over ten years ago, she saved me from bandits. After my illness worsened, she started searching for a cure for me.

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: And then what?

Prospecto: She was running all around the city, but she turned up nothing. But with single-minded devotion, she kept searching for a way to bring me back from the dead. She even went to places more than a thousand miles away, but I knew my body was...

Prospecto: I didn't want her to waste the prime of her youth on my invalid body... After deep soul-searching, I decided to cut off our relationship in the name of pursuing my career in officialdom.

Catho: My Lord really was a top pick to be prime minister ages ago! But he preferred to give up his success rather than forego the promise he made to Evena. That's why he waited so long in the city... if only he hadn't caught that strange illness...

Catho: My Lord has never been some kind of unfaithful playboy! All these years, he's regretted it every day...

Prospecto: Honestly, I don't care how people see me. I just want to know if she's alright or not...

Tea Cake (skin): ……

Chrysanthemum Wine: And if she's not alright now?

Prospecto: She...? You all know her? How is she? What's not alright?

Chrysanthemum Wine: The illness you caught all those years ago was no ordinary illness, but rather caused by an evil demon malingering within you...

Chrysanthemum Wine: That jade was a trade she made with the demon. In order to save you, both her appearance and her fighting skill has diminished. She hasn't been that swashbuckling swordstress you knew for a long time.

Prospecto: I never imagined she would endure so much bitterness for me... Even if that's the case, in my heart she will always be the most beautiful woman in the world.

Prospecto: I only hate myself for not being by her side to take care of her...

Dongtang: If that's so, then what if we gave you that chance today?

Tea Cake (skin): —Oh good! You all came after all!

Narration: A gentle voice suddenly sounded not far away. The crowd turned to look and saw Dongtang supporting a woman as she shuffled over. The woman's eyes were tear-filled, looking past the crowd straight at Prospecto up on the stage: it was Evena.

Prospecto: E-Evena... is it you? Is it really you?!

Evena: I-it's me... After all this time, to be able to hear you say what was in your heart... it... makes me truly happy...

Evena: It's just, my face...

Prospecto: I never cared about that... From now on, just as you once cared for me, now let me care for you.

Evena: I...

Chrysanthemum Wine: I know a physician named Calamus Wine who is an expert in herbal medicine. For your condition, she very well may be able to give you a prescription that offers so remedy.

Prospecto: Don't be afraid, Evena. I'll be with you always.

Evena: ...Yes!

Narration: Seeing the pair happily back together, crying in each other's arms, Tea Cake found herself breaking out in a smile. As she inadvertently caught eyes with Chrysanthemum Wine, the two laughed in unison.

Prospecto: Miss Tea Cake, I can't thank you all enough for this... If not for you, I probably would have held this in my whole life.

Tea Cake (skin): I'm sorry, I took matters into my own hands. I'm especially sorry for blinding repeating what I'd heard the first time I told your story. I didn't want your story to be distorted and misunderstood anymore, so I was forced to come up with this plan.

Tea Cake (skin): There's a saying that what you don't know won't hurt you, but this time I knew that if you could just communicate with each other, this would all be worth it.

Narration: Tea Cake waved her fan and laughed, and the spectators who finally connected all the dots started to shout and cheer.

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: Finally, a happy ending! Looks like praying to the Cowherd and the Weaver Lady wasn't a bad idea after all!

Narration: The group laughed, and someone started playing a graceful and airy tune on the reed pipes again, and everyone started swaying and rocking. The old ship kicked up new ripples that ebbed out into more distant waters. The group laughed, and someone started playing a graceful and airy tune on the reed pipes again, and everyone started swaying and rocking. The old boat kicked up new ripples that ebbed out into more distant waters.

Narration: A proliferation of floating lanterns dotted the river like the stars in the Milky Way above. Their flickering lights shimmered on the undulating waves, and candlelights filled the sky too, carrying the wishes of the people up into the night. Chrysanthemum Wine and Evena were enjoying the view from a small boat.

Evena: Thank you, Chrysanthemum Wine... I took things too much to heart before and, without realizing it, became too timid to act.

Evena: Thankfully you all were there to give me a push and make me remember my former self.

Chrysanthemum Wine: No need for all that thanks. If you didn't have the courage within you, then all of our hard work would've been for nothing.

Narration: Evena let out a relieved laugh, and Chrysanthemum Wine couldn't help smile back. A cool breeze caressed their faces, as if blowing away all the worries that had built up over the years.

Evena: Oh yeah, I don't know when Miss Tea Cake will be doing a storytelling next, but I'll certainly be there to show support.

Chrysanthemum Wine: Good, she'll like that.

Narration: The boat stopped at the bank, and the two parted ways. As Chrysanthemum Wine strolled among the sundry stalls, she happened upon Dongtang and Almond Tofu.

Almond Tofu: Miss Chrysanthemum Wine, we were just going to look for you.

Chrysanthemum Wine: To look for me?

Dongtang: Yes. Almond and the others put together an impromptu party at the tea house. It'll be perfect for watching tonight's fireworks show.

_name_: Night _when_ Ink Pavilion

Narration: The moon was bright, and the breeze was fine. Toasts were being made all around, and Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake drunkenly sloshed his cup around.

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: Good stuff, *hic*!

Laba Noodles: I only left for a minute... How did everyone drink themselves into this state...?

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: Aww, it's just every once in a while! No big deal! Come, try some!

Laba Noodles: Uh, Persimmon, you poured it down my shirt... ugh!

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: Oh yeah, that reminds me, where did that Tea Cake go?

Chrysanthemum Wine: She got stopped on the way here by some playhouse folks. They were waving money around trying to get her to come do a show at their venue. She must've run away somewhere to hide.

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: What? I did a pretty bang-up acting job too! Why didn't they come to me... Forget it. If she's not coming back anyway, then I'll drink this jug for her~!

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: Oh, and Chrysanthemum Wine, we hadn't seen you in ages. Where'd you get off to?

Chrysanthemum Wine: Just the usual places. Nowhere worth mentioning.

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: Aw, don't be like that! Tell us.

Almond Tofu: I wanna hear too, Miss Chrysanthemum Wine!

Dongtang: This is a rare opportunity, Chrysanthemum Wine. Don't spoil everyone's fun.

Tea Cake (skin): That's right. I managed to escape my predicament too, so I have a stake in this. If there's anything fun, I can write it up into a story~

Fire Crystal Persimmon Cake: Tea Cake, when did you get back? And why do you look like a ghost... Ack, and you're stealing my wine! I never did settle the score with you for hitting me today!

Tea Cake (skin): What do you mean, hitting you? That was all just part of the show~

Narration: Seeing that the table had erupted into arguing again, Chrysanthemum Wine let out a resigned sigh and decided to relent.

Chrysanthemum Wine: Guys... Oh, alright...

Narration: A silver moon accented the deep blue night sky. The evening breeze caressed their cheeks with refreshing gusts. Tonight, the bustling city was resplendent shimmering, as if cloaked in a mantle of light.
