    Laba Festival-Dongli Kingdom


Narrator: The snow-covered grassland had just a thin layer of white, already marked by a jumble of footprints, while outside Agate Fishball's tent, it was bustling with crowds.

Chicken on Lotus Leaf: Everyone, don’t rush! Come one by one~ Don’t worry, everyone will get a blessing banner!

Villager A: That’s awesome! I heard these banners were personally made by the Emperor! Look at the celestial cranes on them—so beautiful!

Villager C: The Emperor is truly talented in both literature and martial arts! Just look at this grain bounty design. The stitching is so fine, it’s so lifelike!

Village B: Wait, why does mine look so strange? This embroidery doesn’t look like a cow or a dog—what the heck is it?

Villager A: Let me see… Hey, this is weird. It looks kind of scary—could it be some divine beast from the sky?

Villager C: Don’t say that… it really is! The more you look, the creepier it gets. Huh? I think mine has one too! Let’s take a closer look… it seems like everyone’s banners have…

Village B: Well… the Emperor must have her reasons for drawing it this way… Hey, Chicken on Lotus Leaf—do you know what this pattern is?

Chicken on Lotus Leaf: Uh...

Agate Fish Ball: I embroidered that myself. It doesn’t really have any specific meaning. Just think of it as my stamp.

Villager A: The Emperor is here—wait, is this for real?! Did I hear that right?!

Village B: It’s really embroidered by the Emperor!! I have to take it home and frame it… it’s a family heirloom! Yeah, let’s call it a family treasure!

Villager C: The Emperor stitched it! I knew it had to be a divine beast! You can just tell it’s extraordinary! Thank you, Your Majesty! Thank you

Narrator: As the villagers excitedly rubbed their hands over the "real deal," a young man who had slowly walked over to Agate chuckled and sighed.

Agate Fish Ball: Look, I didn’t expect them to be this happy. Seems like there are people in the Dongli who appreciate my ‘work’~

Walnut Porridge: If it weren’t for Million Dollar Stew redoing the design, you wouldn’t feel like you contributed enough, and you insisted on stitching a few stitches on each banner… I really wouldn’t want your ‘work’ to be spread around like this…

Agate Fish Ball: Haha, Walnut Porridge, you’re still so blunt.

Walnut Porridge: Being straightforward is a minister’s duty…

Agate Fish Ball: Alright, my dear Chancellor—now isn’t the time for political discussions, so don’t put on that serious face.

Walnut Porridge: ...

Walnut Porridge: I know you want to draw some sketches yourself and don’t want anyone else to do it for you… It really wouldn’t have been hard; why didn’t you just ask me to teach you to draw back then?

Agate Fish Ball: Because I was afraid that if I didn’t learn well, it would only make you even more upset.

Walnut Porridge: Teach you? I wouldn’t know how…

Agate Fish Ball: Haha, right, I almost forgot. I doodled a little something while practicing earlier—

Walnut Porridge: ...What's this?

Narrator: Walnut Porridge took the drawing paper and saw a rough sketch of a weird shape that barely resembled a face.

Agate Fish Ball: Your little portrait! It’s for you, and it’s a real ‘special edition’.

Walnut Porridge: ...

Agate Fish Ball: Wow, it’s rare that my Chancellor isn’t being ‘blunt’ this time. Why are you so eager to hide it in your sleeve? Afraid someone might snatch it away?

Walnut Porridge: I don’t want a third person to see such a frightening drawing… I’ll keep it safe myself.

Agate Fish Ball: Haha, as long as you like it!
