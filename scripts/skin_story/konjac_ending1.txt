    On the day of Qixi Festival-Chengdong Restaurant


Narration: The news of the reform of the Qiaoguo Competition quickly spread throughout the streets. Some people came for the Qixi Festival, while others came to witness the winners. For a while, the restaurant was bustling with people, comparable to a busy city.

Dong'an Chicken: Wow, there are so many foods! Spicy and sour konjac, I saw our glutinous rice cakes!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Good, I like this layout~

Narration: The hot and sour konjac, which had specially changed into new clothes, was strolling around with the Dong'an chicken. When I saw my own konjac placed in the middle of the long table, I felt very comfortable.

Narration: The dishes displayed around had their own merits, except for the plate of glutinous rice cakes, which was plain and simple. However, together with the lively storytelling of the young girl in green next door, it attracted the crowd to come and watch.

Dong'an Chicken: Listen to the spicy and sour konjac, the storyteller seems to be telling the story of Granny Jia and Qiaoguo!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Humph, even after working for so long, my skills are still not rusty~ But... why do I always feel like that storyteller has stolen the limelight...

Restaurant Waiter: Dear guests, you are here! The boss just asked me to find you, saying that your cookies are very popular with customers. I hope you can serve them as a special dish of the restaurant for a limited time during Chinese Valentine's Day!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): It's not a big problem. Good things should be shared together.

Burnt Grass Jelly: Oh? But the money you spent on making those cookies these days is still charged to the game hall's account.

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Wow, boss, where did you come from? You scared me to death...

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Wait a minute... What do you mean by put it on the game hall's account? Aren't those things all from Dong'an Chicken?

Dong'an Chicken: Me? How is that possible? I don't have that much money. I ran into the owner of the Herbal Jelly Restaurant when I was running errands for you. She lent me a large sum of money without saying a word.

Dong'an Chicken: The owner of the restaurant also told me not to be frugal and to buy the best ingredients, so that I could put my worries to rest as soon as possible.

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): What? Boss, did you really say that? ? I didn't expect you to care about me so much. It must be because I have been working so hard that you...

Burnt Grass Jelly: Compared to your hard work, I actually care more about my kitchen. Before you praise me, why don't you take a closer look at this?

Narration: Before the spicy and sour konjac could react, he watched the grass jelly slowly take out an account book, and a hint of coolness could not help but climb up his back.

Burnt Grass Jelly: Every expense is clearly recorded on it, plus the hours of absence from work... I calculated for you, it's just that you have to work another half a year~

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): ...Wait, why do you charge for boiling an extra pot of water? That's too stingy!

Burnt Grass Jelly: This will help you pay off your debts sooner. After all, it's rare to find such a fun-loving worker.

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): What a scary woman she is... Humph, just wait, I will eventually earn enough money for the journey!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): ——But no matter what, today is a good day. I will treat you to a big meal at the restaurant! Boss Jia will pay for it anyway~

Dong'an Chicken: Tsk tsk, how can you call it treating if you let others pay the bill?

Dong'an Chicken: Hey, owner of the Herbal Jelly Restaurant, why are you suddenly laughing?

Burnt Grass Jelly: Haha, nothing, I just think it's particularly interesting~ It seems that letting Sour and Spicy Konjac to work in the game hall was indeed the right choice~

Dong'an Chicken: Why does it sound like... the days of spicy and sour konjac will not be easy in the future... Every time the owner of the restaurant makes trouble for us, he has the same expression...

Narration: Seeing the Grass Jelly's unfathomable smile, Dong'an Chicken scratched its head in confusion, thought for a few seconds, and gave up resolutely, and hurriedly caught up with the Spicy and Sour Konjac in front.

Narration: The Grass Jelly, which was walking leisurely behind the two of them, witnessed the whole process calmly and composedly, as Spicy and Sour Konjac was feeling aggrieved one moment and then regained his composure the next moment, which made him feel a little funny.

Burnt Grass Jelly: (Although this guy is usually carefree and always wants to travel around the world, but...)

Narration: No one understands what is in his heart better than him - even if the mountains are far away and the waters are vast, and the road ahead is still long, he will never forget to savor the present.
