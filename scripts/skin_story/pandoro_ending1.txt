    Christmas Day - Outside The Castle


Narration: Pandoro walked alone down the snow-covered streets, distant carols drifting through the air, and the passing people were all smiling.

Narration: Yet, gazing at the familiar streets before her, a tinge of sadness welled up inside her heart.

Pandoro (skin): If only... this wasn't an illusion...

Pandoro (skin): I really wish this could all be real... then everyone's smiles would never fade...

City Citizen A: Wow! It's snowing!!

City Citizen B: The snow is beautiful this year too! I hope it snows like this every year!

Narration: The lively chatter snapped Pandoro out of her thoughts, as the cool touch of a few snowflakes brushed her cheeks.

Narration: Just as she was about to look up at the sky, a large umbrella was gently placed above her.

Wiener Schnitzel: You'll catch a cold standing in the snow like that, miss.

Pandoro (skin): Wiener...?

Deviled Egg: Hey, we agreed to go to the amusement park today. Don't tell me you forgot? If we're late, we'll miss the limited-edition prizes!

Deviled Egg: That oversized bunny plushie you wanted might get snatched up by someone else~

Pandoro (skin): Wha...! Who said I wanted that!

Wiener Schnitzel: Haha, we still have time if we head over now.

Narration: Their usual playful banter filled Pandoro's heart. She hesitated for a moment but then beamed brightly.

Pandoro (skin): Ahem, of course, I didn't forget! Let's go right now!

Narration: As they walked, the falling snow and the sound of laughter surrounded them. Wiener Schnitzel subtly glanced away, noticing how Pandoro carefully took in every scene, as if committing it all to memory.

Wiener Schnitzel: Miss, there's no need to be sad, even if this place right now is...

Pandoro (skin): Thank you, Wiener. I know what you're going to say.

Pandoro (skin): But I'm not sad, because I believe this isn't just a dream. One day, I'll break free from that cageâ€”with everyone by my side. You feel the same way, right?

Narration: Her unexpected response took Wiener Schnitzel by surprise, but as their eyes met, clear and determined, he knew she had already found her answer.

Wiener Schnitzel: Of course, miss. We'll always be together, no matter what.

Pandoro (skin): Yeah! So I'm sure my brothers will be back safe and sound very soon!


    A While Ago - Somewhere


Reuben Sandwich: Ugh...!

Narration: The young man in the corner winced, a flicker of light escaping his purple eyes as a wave of pain coursed through him, making his whole body tremble.

Reuben Sandwich: (That fool really did... leave the ruins of the Fallen Angel...)

Welsh Rarebit: Hey, are you okay...?

Reuben Sandwich: ...Don't worry about me.

Welsh Rarebit: I think you should rest a few more days. You can't just die here.

Reuben Sandwich: No need. I've already made a promise to that woman.

Reuben Sandwich: (...Looks like I need to hurry, before he finds me.)

Reuben Sandwich: (I won't let any of you get hurt again... Never...)
