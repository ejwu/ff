Vidal Ice Wine: Eh? Are you dissatisfied with Macaroni?

Feteer: No, although as a "shell" he's still too fragile, but... in other aspects, he's already the most suitable.

Vidal Ice Wine: Then... why let him go?

Feteer: Because it was his own choice.

Feteer: Love is a fascinating thing. I learned a lot from him.

Vidal Ice Wine: ...

Narration: Weidel quietly looked at the "god" in front of him, unconsciously clenching his fist hidden under his sleeve.

Feteer: You're very angry.

Vidal Ice Wine: No, how could that be?

Feteer: No need to hide it. In front of the "god," you have nowhere to escape.

Vidal Ice Wine: ...

Feteer: No need to be angry, because... we won't meet again in this form.

Vidal Ice Wine: No need to be angry, because... we won't meet again in this form.

Feteer: The form of cooperation.

Vidal Ice Wine: Why? Did I do something to upset you?

Feteer: You don't need to know. But...

Feteer: You can continue your own plans. Whether it's searching for Moloccia or collecting fragments of the Time-Space Wheel...

Vidal Ice Wine: !

Feteer: I don't care what you do, because in the end, I'll take back those things.

Narration: The mask loosened slightly, casting a gloomy hue on Vidal's face, reflected in Feteer's eyes.

Vidal Ice Wine: Hehe, as expected, I still can't win against a god...

Feteer: Don't worry. I'm different from "that god." I love humanity, so I let that "shell" make his own choices...

Feteer: He didn't want to be a "container," immersing his consciousness in a beautiful dream, so I let him go and will make up for the mistakes "that god" made on him...

Feteer: I did better than "that god," so I can replace Him. So no matter what you did, I still love you, and I won't punish you for your betrayal, or rather...

Feteer: This punishment is already enough.

Narration: A cold hand gently stroked Vidal's head, then withdrew without any reluctance.

Narration: Vidal stared at the spot where the platinum-colored figure disappeared, finally showing a displeased smile after a long moment.

Vidal Ice Wine: Hehe...

Vidal Ice Wine: Truly worthy of a god, with just a few words, everything I did before was all for nothing...

Vidal Ice Wine: What's useless to you doesn't mean it's useless to me... Even as a test subject, Macaroni still has value. How could I just let him go like that...

Narration: The soft mask was put back on Vidal's face, the sweet smile like honey dripping over the meticulously woven web of a poisonous spider.

Vidal Ice Wine: With this, the battle with the 'god'... is about to get serious~
