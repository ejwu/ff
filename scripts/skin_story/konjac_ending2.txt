    On the day of Qixi Festival-Nanli Printing House


Spicy and sour konjac (skin): It’s strange, where did that Dong’an Chicken go? He said he would go to the Qixi Festival today.

Narration: Spicy Konjac looked around but couldn't find the familiar figure for a while. Just as he was muttering to himself, he heard a rustling sound beside his ears.

Narration: When he followed the noise to the kitchen, he saw the Dong'an chickens gathered around the table, fiddling with something.

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Are these the leftovers and failed products from making glutinous rice cakes these days? What do you do with them?

Dong'an Chicken: Because I'm going to collect them all and make something new so no food goes to waste!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Well, not bad. It seems that you have made a lot of progress in learning cooking from me.

Dong'an Chicken: After listening to Granny Jia’s story, I realized that a small amount of food can have such a big impact... So I must respect and cherish every food in the future!

Narration: As if inspired by an invisible force, the boy's eyes were bright and the words he uttered were particularly powerful.

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): I was right about you. Since you have such awareness, why don't you travel with me and try all the delicacies in the world? Wait... This seems to save me some travel expenses.

Dong'an Chicken: ah?

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Ahem, nothing. By the way, I made a new kind of cookie today. How about you try it for me first? It’s in the shape of a red bird~

Narration: As expected, Dong'an Chicken's attention was immediately attracted. A bag of hot and sour konjac was taken out, and the red konjac was baked into the shape of a red bird with its wings spread, which looked ruddy and lifelike.

Narration: Dongan Chicken swallowed a piece impatiently, but his face suddenly turned red.

Dong'an Chicken: Ahem! It’s so spicy!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Hey, this is my secret spicy seasoning. How about it? It tastes good, right?

Dong'an Chicken: This is too spicy...!!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): It is said that Suzaku loves fire, so naturally he also likes spicy food. If you can't stand this level... how can you follow Suzaku-sama in the future, don't you think?

Dong'an Chicken: Really, really, really?! Oh no… That won’t do! ! I have to keep up with Master Suzaku! Give me all the remaining cookies, I will eat them all!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Hahahaha——

Dong'an Chicken: You, what are you laughing at?

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Nothing~ I just suddenly felt that among Suzaku's followers there is someone with your character, which is not bad~

Dong'an Chicken: Huh?? I don’t understand…

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand. Let’s just get out of here quickly, otherwise we might miss the Qixi Festival party.

Dong'an Chicken: Wow, wait a minute—you haven’t given me the chocolate yet!

Spicy and sour konjac (skin): Why are you in such a hurry? I'll give it to you after I improve it.
