    Christmas Day - At Amusement Park_


Sticky Toffee Pudding: What... you want to patrol around the park? Why not join Deviled Egg and have some fun?

Pandoro (skin): I'm no longer a kid. I don't spend all day thinking about playing. Since Tomahawk isn't here, the job naturally falls to me.

Sticky Toffee Pudding: I know you're worried about the situation, but it's fine. It's safe right now.

Pandoro (skin): But...! I don't want anything like that to happen again...

Narration: Seeing the worry in her eyes, Sticky Toffee Pudding gave a gentle smile and comforted her.

Sticky Toffee Pudding: Weiner told me how much you've helped out recently, and thanks to you all, I've been able to recover.

Sticky Toffee Pudding: This amusement park isn't just everyone's wish, it's mine too. It was built with everyone's hard work.

Sticky Toffee Pudding: Maybe the park isn't real, but as long as everyone's happiness and feelings are real, that's all that matters.

Pandoro (skin): Toffee...

Sticky Toffee Pudding: This park was made for Christmas, and if you can't enjoy it, then there's no point.

Pandoro (skin): Yeah, I get it!

Deviled Egg: Pandoro, why are you still here? Oh, Toffee's here too!

Sticky Toffee Pudding: Yeah, you two go have fun. I'll stay here.

Rachel Sandwich: Actually, why don't the three of us go on that flying coaster together?

Deviled Egg: Uh... Sister Rachel, it's called a roller coaster!

Rachel Sandwich: Names don't matter. Chicken à la King rode it once and already got dizzy. I still want to try it at max speed.

Pandoro (skin): Uh... Wiener said she was looking for me earlier...!

Deviled Egg: ...Ahahaha, I think I left my pumpkin prop by the carousel!

Rachel Sandwich: You two aren't trying to sneak off, are you? This is perfect training, no excuses!

Narration: Rachel Sandwich raised an eyebrow and grabbed the two, dragging them toward the roaring roller coaster, leaving their cries echoing in the air.


    Evening - At Amusement Park_


Deviled Egg: This park is amazing! This will be my second home from now on!

Pandoro (skin): Tsk, laughing so much now, but who was crying alot in the haunted house earlier?

Deviled Egg: W-Who said that? Chicken à la King was scared too! He even lost some feathers!

Chicken à la King: Ahem, young master, there's no need to bring that up... Besides, you were the one pulling me in front of you the whole time...

Wiener Schnitzel: Hehe, I wouldn't mind going back for more haunted house training with the young master and butler. Who knows, you might even beat Tomahawk and Reuben when they return.

Deviled Egg: Really? Stronger than my brothers... Let's go right now!

Chicken à la King: But... there are other ways to train courage... Besides, beating them in haunted house skills isn't that great of an accomplishment, is it...?

Deviled Egg: If it feels like an accomplishment to us, that's what matters!

Narration: As Pandoro listened to the lively chatter of her friends, her eyes landed on the slightly silly Deviled Egg. She couldn't help but smile wryly, but also felt a small sense of relief inside—sometimes, it was nice to not know everything.

Pandoro (skin): (If only, that guy could keep smiling like this forever.)

Narration: In a corner where no one else noticed, her heart grew more determined. She stepped forward, joining the group.

Pandoro (skin): Wait for me! I want to go to the haunted house too! I can't miss Deviled Egg's embarrassing moments!

Deviled Egg: You...!! Hmph, we'll see who's embarrassed!

Narration: Not far away

Sticky Toffee Pudding: Rachel, aren't you going with them? It's still early.

Rachel Sandwich: ...Maybe I've ridden the coaster too many times, I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

Sticky Toffee Pudding: The park is a place for joy, so while you're here, you can leave some worries behind.

Rachel Sandwich: ...

Narration: Before Rachel could respond, Sticky Toffee Pudding looked toward the glittering lights ahead, her soft eyes reflecting the mingling figures of her friends.

Sticky Toffee Pudding: I know the road ahead will be difficult, but as long as we're together

Sticky Toffee Pudding: We'll surely have a Christmas belongs to Specter family
