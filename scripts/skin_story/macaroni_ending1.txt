Macaroni: Strange... It's too strange...

Saskatoon Berry Pie: Yeah... There's no...

Moules Frites: Our wanted posters anywhere.

Narration: The four gathered together, each frowning and deep in thought.

Pavlova: Perhaps Vidal resolved the issue?

Macaroni: That guy was eager for us to be wanted so he could keep us at his company and use us. How could he help us like this...

Saskatoon Berry Pie: Yeah, he was the one who told us we were wanted.

Moules Frites: Could it be that he deliberately tricked us into thinking we were wanted to keep us trapped there... when in reality, there was nothing like that?

Macaroni: Impossible... I definitely ate those workers' hearts. So many people died, how could we not be wanted...

Saskatoon Berry Pie: Although I don't know why, isn't this just perfect?

Saskatoon Berry Pie: We're not wanted anymore, and we've left Paradise Manufacturer. We can live normal lives...

Macaroni: Even though I don't have a heart, I still understand shame. Killing so many people without facing any punishment, living without any burden...

Macaroni: I can't do that.

Saskatoon Berry Pie: But you have no choice either...

Macaroni: Stop talking. You understand that's not right, right?

Saskatoon Berry Pie: ...

Macaroni: Alright, I'll go check elsewhere. Maybe there's no wanted poster around here... You all wait here for me, don't wander around.

Saskatoon Berry Pie: Mmm...

Narration: Macaroni went out onto the street, but from every alley and the police station entrance, there was no sign of the wanted posters. Even when the sheriff saw his face, he had no reaction.

Macaroni: What's going on...

Man: Ah! Isn't this Mr. Macaroni?!

Macaroni: You...!

Narration: He looked in surprise at the person who suddenly called out to himâ€”that was a former worker from the toy factory, someone who should have already died.

Man: Where have you all been these days? I've been looking for you for so long and couldn't find you...

Man: I'm really sorry... I didn't go to work that day. Maybe I got too drunk at the "celebration"...

Macaroni: Celebration?

Man: Uh, yeah... We were celebrating all day that day, maybe went out drinking the night before and got completely wasted...

Macaroni: You all? Not just you?

Man: Y-Yeah... Drinking is more fun with more people, though we all forgot how we ended up drinking at such an expensive place during the celebration...

Man: But why did the toy factory close? It can't be because none of us went to work that day...

Narration: Macaroni was stunned for a moment, then finally realized something and showed his usual smile again.

Macaroni: Celebration, huh... That's quite a significant debt... Heh...

Macaroni: The toy factory's closure isn't your problem. It's just... Saskatoon and I found what we truly want to do.

Macaroni: Soon... Gloriville will have a new toy factory. Please look forward to it~
